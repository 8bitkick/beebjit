essentially it GPL v3.

beebjit is built atop much historical effort. The following software inspired
beebjit, and served as direct reference material for implementation subtleties.

- BeebEm: the first emulator on which I was able to replay Exile.

- B-em: the first emulator on which I was able to replay Exile glitch-free.

- jsbeeb: providing hassle-free instant BBC experience in the browser!

- b2: a fresh perspective on clean code organization and component separation
as routes to accurate emulation.


The following people have been instrumental:
- All members of Bitshifters.
- The Stardot community, for patience running tons of test cases on real
hardware.

- Kieran Connell, for inspiration via Twisted Brain and being a general retro
coding machine.
- Adrian Gilby, for inspiration via Wave Runner and for the loan of the model
B issue 3!
- Matt Godbolt, for jsbeeb and for being far too jolly!
- Tom Seddon, for inspiration via Wave Runner and for b2. (In particular, b2's
video emulation has been a critical reference.)
- Rich Talbot-Watkins for pairing up to understand some extremely tough
corner cases, and for various critical test programs.
- Sarah Walker, for inspiriation via numerous demos, for b-em and for patience
when answering basic electrical engineering questions.
