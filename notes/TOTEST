A list of little tests pending on real hardware.

PENDING


RESOLVED
- What if you have a long cursor, does it render past the screen border?
MODE 0
?&248=&FC
A) Yes. See https://stardot.org.uk/forums/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=17789

- Extent of ROMSEL and ULA mapping on BBC B?
?&FE3F=0
?&FE2E=0
A) Both are mapped to a full 16 byte region.

- What are the power-on values of the light pen registers?
Various on a BBC B (issue 7?). R16/R17: 0, 0. 20, 127. 0, 127. 0, 127. 0, 127. 52, 127.
Various on a BBC B (issue 3). R16/R17: 62, 127. 62, 127. 63, 127.

- What if display is off, cursor is on, does cursor render?
MODE2:?&FE00=8:?&FE01=&31
It does. Blank screen.
(Note: on NULA, cursor doesn't render.)

- What value does DCD show for silence, tone, data?
9  REM neither RS423 nor tape owns serial
10 ?&EA=&41
19 REM motor on, usual serial rates
20 ?&FE10=&85
29 REM no IRQs, 8-bit and stop bits
30 ?&FE08=&55
40 C%=0
50 S%=?&FE08
60 B%=?&FE09
70 N%=S% AND 4
80 IF N% <> C% THEN PRINT N%:C%=N%
90 GOTO 50
DCD blips on and off quickly, even for a long tone.
DCD blips the same way, for initial carrier or intra-block carrier.
DCD does stay high until data register is read (as per data sheet).
DCD does NOT blip for the short intra-block carrier on Star Drifter.
DCD blips twice for a carrier tone with dummy byte.
DCD blip seems to last about 210us. Could be half a 2400Hz cycle.
DCD blip occurs after 174ms of tone (issue 3 beeb).

- Memory values post power on.
On BBC B (issue 7?):
&800: 66, 8, ... variable
&9E:  0,  0,  0,  seems always 0
On BBC B (issue 3):
&800: 255, always?
&9E: 255, always?

- What if cursor start line > cursor end line? What renders?
?&FE00=10:?&FE01=1
?&FE00=11:?&FE01=0
No cursor renders (ULA and NULA).

- What if a skewed cursor start is outside the border, does it render?
?&FE00=8:?&FE01=&81
Yes.

- Check what happens if you set skew=1 in a normal mode, e.g. MODE 0.
(Looks same as jsbeeb.)

- Does display still get enabled for start of frame if vdisp is vtotal?
Yes (probably it never gets turned off).
MODE 0:?&FE00=6:?&FE01=39
Interestingly, the cursor stops blinking which tells us where cursor frames
are counted? All emulators get this wrong at time of discovery.

- Do you get a vsync IRQ if vsync position is 0?
Yes. Weirdness in interlace mode where looks sometimes >>50Hz??

- Do you get a vsync IRQ if vsync position is vtotal?
Yes. Surprise! IRQ but poor monitor sync. IRQ looks to be @ 25Hz.

- What displays with R9=31, MODE 0?
Each character row is about 4x deeper of course to about 4 standard character
rows and these 4 look like: data, blank, data repeat, blank.
MODE 0:?&FE00=9:?&FE01=31

- What displays with R5=31? (R9=7)
Strange one, this. Scanlines:
0-7:   effectively R4+1
8-15:  blank
16-23: effectively R4+2
24-30: blank

- Can vsync + IRQ trigger twice in one frame?
Yes. crtc.ssd:SYNCX2

- How does the teletext SAA5050 decide its time for a new scanline?
6845 DISPTMG is wired to SAA5050 LOSE, confirmed with scope.

- How does the teletext SAA5050 decide if its the odd or even frame?
6845 RA0 is wired, via an inverter, to SAA5050 CRS, confirmed with scope.
