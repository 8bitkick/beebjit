A list of little tests pending on real hardware.

PENDING
- What if display is off, cursor is on, does cursor render?
MODE2:?&FE00=8:?&FE01=&31

- What if a skewed cursor start is outside the border, does it render?

- What if cursor start line > cursor end line? What renders?

- Check again what happens if you set skew=1 in a normal mode, e.g. MODE 0.

- Do you get a vsync if vsync position is 0?

- Does display still get enabled for start of frame if vdisp is vtotal?


RESOLVED
- What if you have a long cursor, does it render past the screen border?
MODE 0
?&248=&FC
A) Yes. See https://stardot.org.uk/forums/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=17789

- Extent of ROMSEL and ULA mapping on BBC B?
?&FE3F=0
?&FE2E=0
A) Both are mapped to a full 16 byte region.
