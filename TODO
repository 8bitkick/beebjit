Bugs and improvements
=====================

Bugs: known bugs and deficiencies that are sufficiently egregious that they'll
get addressed.


Ideas
=====

Ideas: ideas sufficiently interesting that they are likely to be investigated
and implemented.

- Record and playback. Since the "accurate" mode has deterministic execution
behavior, we can "record" a machine session by just logging and playing back
the sources of non-determinism -- i.e. key presses and releases.
A recording can be exited at any time, fast forwarded, etc. One great use
would be to record run-throughs of tricky games (i.e. Exile), which can be
"taken over" at any point.


Backburner
==========

Backburner: ideas or bugs that aren't particularly important to fix.

- JIT vectorization optimization. The BBC operates a byte at a time, including
instances where its updating a multi-byte quantity, i.e. 4-byte numbers in
BASIC.
These code patterns are fairly apparent so it would be possible to optimize to
single 4-byte operations on the host CPU.
However, initial experimentation didn't reveal any obvious gains worth the
complexity. The CLOCKSP Trig/Log test does a lot of rotating of 4-byte values
and the improvement of doing that in one 4-byte operating was surprisingly
low.
