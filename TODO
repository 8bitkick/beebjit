Bugs and improvements
=====================

IMPORTANT
=========
Known bugs and deficiencies that are sufficiently egregious that they'll
get addressed before the next release.

- Add README and EXAMPLES files.
- Investigate why cpu-scale-factor of e.g. 16 causes load failures (Elite,
Exile).
- Make timing.c not suck for performance.
- Investigate if the 1kHz system tick drives the audio too hard, or whether it
can even block at that resolution.
- Uridium JIT crash after ship blows up.
- Re-add unit test for JIT block handling and splitting etc.
- MODE7 graphics rendering has gaps.
- BCD support in JIT?


Fix later
=========
Bugs and issues not serious enough to warrant fixing before the next release.

- JIT block timing code improvements. Currently, there's a non-trivial
instruction sequence after every conditional branch in a JIT block. This
sequence can be improved a lot. For example, there only needs to be a branch
at the start of the block. Also, the timing subtractions do not need to be
dependent on one another.
- Acornsoft Chess self-play should be faster in JIT + fast mode.
- Fix joystick issue with "The Attic Bug in SameGame":
http://bbcmicro.co.uk/game.php?id=1891
- Fix Dragonsoft Explorer.
- Fix IRA read and keyboard bus dominance.
- Add cursor support to the 6845 CRTC.
- Add tape loading support.
- MODE7 not centered.
- MODE7 not fully wired up, e.g. Firetrack loader overscan doesn't work.
- Add fdi disc format support.
- Add fsd disc format support.
- MODE7 doesn't have character rounding.
- Fix Elite-A (file not found trying to launch ship)
- MODE7 rendering error (graphics hold support)? in Revs loading screen helmet.
- Remove crufty old rendering code for -fast mode.


Ideas
=====

Ideas: ideas sufficiently interesting that they are likely to be investigated
and implemented.

- Record and playback. Since the "accurate" mode has deterministic execution
behavior, we can "record" a machine session by just logging and playing back
the sources of non-determinism -- i.e. key presses and releases.
A recording can be exited at any time, fast forwarded, etc. One great use
would be to record run-throughs of tricky games (i.e. Exile), which can be
"taken over" at any point.

- Terminal (and headless terminal) modes. Rewires serial I/O to stdio.
[half done]

- Rewind.
Possibly linked to record and playback above, rewind would go back in time a
little bit when a key is hit.


Backburner
==========

Backburner: ideas or bugs that aren't particularly important to fix.

- JIT vectorization optimization. The BBC operates a byte at a time, including
instances where its updating a multi-byte quantity, i.e. 4-byte numbers in
BASIC.
These code patterns are fairly apparent so it would be possible to optimize to
single 4-byte operations on the host CPU.
However, initial experimentation didn't reveal any obvious gains worth the
complexity. The CLOCKSP Trig/Log test does a lot of rotating of 4-byte values
and the improvement of doing that in one 4-byte operating was surprisingly
low.
- Master support. Initial focus is on good BBC model B emulation.
- Save state / load state.
