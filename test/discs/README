These discs are interesting in some way for emulator behavior testing.

By Kieran Connell.
Triggers interesting MODE 7 character states.

- pi.ssd
From https://github.com/mattgodbolt/jsbeeb/issues/115
Seems to use a page-crossing JMP ind.

- PLAY_DISC.ssd, SAVE_DISC.ssd
From https://github.com/mattgodbolt/jsbeeb/issues/198
Disc for drives 0 / 1 for Dragonsoft Explorer.
Dragonsoft Explorer requires sideways RAM and has a custom disc loading
routine that issue unusual i8271 commands directly.
Also seems to do timing / video tricks.

- ReetPetite.ssd
From https://github.com/mattgodbolt/jsbeeb/issues/167
From http://bbcmicro.co.uk/gameimg/discs/1411/ReetPetite.ssd
Sampled sound playback, uses tone channel period of 4.

- Speech.dsd
From https://github.com/mattgodbolt/jsbeeb/issues/193
From http://bbcmicro.co.uk/gameimg/discs/1411/Speech.dsd
Very unusual sampled sound playback routine, uses tone channel period of 8(!)
and does not toggle the sound write enable bit.

- tyb-enjoy.ssd
From https://github.com/mattgodbolt/jsbeeb/issues/122
From https://bitshifters.github.io/posts/archives/tyb-enjoy.html
Sampled sound playback, needs sideways RAM, uses tone channel period of 4.

- upside-doom.ssd
By Kieran Connell.
CRTC test case that uses a multiple frames per horizontal line, and illustrates
the CRTC quirk of "no display on last horizontal character".

- upside-doom-no-skew.ssd
By Kieran Connell.
As above but uses a strange skew trick to avoid the problem of "no display on
last horizontal character".
