These discs are interesting in some way for emulator behavior testing.

- Disc103-OddJobD.ssd
Seems to require DFS-1.2 to correctly load.

- Disc106-AtticBugInSameGame.ssd
Reads ADC conversion (joystick position) and starts game if non-central.

- Disc116-DevilsIslandSTD.ssd
Complicated video timing setup with MODE7 switch halfway down the screen.

- EliteA-unofficial.ssd
Has bug where it relies on disc spindown invalidating drive ready status. If
the drive ready isn't invalidated, pressing f0 to start the game and launch
the ship will fail.

- PharaohsCurse.ssd
Requires crazy light pen simulation support before game will start. No actual
light pen required, it's an internal fakery between system VIA and CRTC.

- PLAY_DISC.ssd, SAVE_DISC.ssd
Disc for drives 0 / 1 for Dragonsoft Explorer.
Dragonsoft Explorer requires sideways RAM and has a custom disc loading
routine that issue unusual i8271 commands directly.
Also seems to do timing / video tricks.

- ReetPetite.ssd
Sampled sound playback, uses tone channel period of 4.

- Repton2-alt.ssd
Has an issue (bug?) that leaves the Speech subsystem latched on.

- Speech.dsd
Very unusual sampled sound playback routine, uses tone channel period of 8(!)
and does not toggle the sound write enable bit.

- tyb-enjoy.ssd
Sampled sound playback, needs sideways RAM, uses tone channel period of 4.
