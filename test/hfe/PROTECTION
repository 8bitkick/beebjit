Generating some beeb disc protection schemes, most not-seen-before.

1) Data hidden in clock bits.
Has two different sector headers read into the same sector data, offset by 1
bit. This leads to one header reading the data and the other reading the clocks
associated with that data.
There are a lot of constraints on what clock bits are valid with what data bits.
Mainly, you can never have a 0 clock bit next to a 0 data bit.
Within the constraints, simple deterministic schemes can be devised. It is
unlikely this setup can be written without specialized hardware.
